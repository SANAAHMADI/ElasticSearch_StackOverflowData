As long as you use the random number returned from the distribution unchanged as a key, you're going to have this problem.","2008-09-11 10:06:51","","2963","CC BY-SA 2.5"
"98155016","55738787","0","Every nonzero value in a represent a block of instances. I need to sum up any nonzero value adjacent to each other to observe the length of the instances. Summing all elements would not help my objectives since I need it to be separate. 0 in the list means that there is a break in instances occurance. Hope you get what I mean","2019-04-18 03:45:45","","4643715","CC BY-SA 4.0"

"98155247","55738892","0","I don't understand the last two lines of your ""sliding"" array. From the first three it looks like you have the array`a[0]` moving to the left (although they differ at `a[5]`, as `a[5] = 8`) but then the two last lines seem to contradict that, as `[14, 3, 30, _, _, _,]` looks utterly unrelated to `[_, _, 38, 20, 31, 33]`, so I have no idea what you are trying to achieve.","2019-04-18 04:05:38","","9546874","CC BY-SA 4.0"
