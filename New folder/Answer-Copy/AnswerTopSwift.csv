I find this question very interesting and I hope that someone will have a compelling case on the defense.","2014-06-06 12:11:13","","468327","CC BY-SA 3.0"
"103923548","56491881","94","The showing of the keyboard and it obscuring content on the screen has been around since what, the first Objective C iPhone app? This is problem that is *constantly* being solved. I for one am disappointed that Apple has not addressed this with SwiftUi. I know this comment is not helpful to anyone, but I wanted to raise this issue that we really should be putting pressure on Apple to provide a solution and not rely on the community to always supply this most common of problems.","2019-11-12 17:00:34","","7104821","CC BY-SA 4.0"

"49763074","30859334","87","I think questions like this one about differences between languages are really useful for understanding language features. And I don't think they lead to unnecessary opinionated answers nor are very easy to find the answer to in documentation. So I don't think the down votes on this question are justified.","2015-06-16 06:31:47","","452775","CC BY-SA 3.0"
