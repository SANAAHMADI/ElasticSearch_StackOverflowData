"67545882","442556","28","I'm surprised to hear that seeking a specification or standard ""tend[s] to attract opinionated answers ..."". I can understand why discussion of a spec or standard would create such problems, but a spec itself is simply a concrete fact. Either it exists or it doesn't, and an answerer either knows where it exists or not. Given the importance of specs and standards in helping modern software -- the most complex artifacts people have ever built -- interoperate, I think that the SO guidelines should be altered to allow these types of questions.","2016-10-19 17:40:19","","509882","CC BY-SA 3.0"
"19995904","156503","27","The problem with any other approach but this is that they invariably end the test once the exception has been thrown. I, on the other hand, often still want to call `org.mockito.Mockito.verify` with various parameters to make sure that certain things happened (such that a logger service was called with the correct parameters) before the exception was thrown.","2013-01-17 11:05:54","","1333157","CC BY-SA 3.0"
"6714717","5845990","22","I haven't worked with Maven 3, but my first guess would be that your test class is in src/main/java and your POM defines junit as a test dependency (that is, the value of the ""scope"" element is ""test"").  I can't say for sure without seeing your POM and knowing the structure of your project, though.","2011-05-01 02:30:52","","299222","CC BY-SA 3.0"
