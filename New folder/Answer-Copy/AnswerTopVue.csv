"82229084","47634258","36","The key concept to understand is that the DOM is updated *asynchronously*. When you change a value in Vue, the change is not *immediately* rendered to the DOM. Instead, Vue queues a DOM update and then, on a timer, updates the DOM. Normally, this happens so fast that it doesn't make a difference, but, at times, you need to update the rendered DOM after Vue has rendered it, which you can't immediately do in a method because the update hasn't happened yet. In those cases, you would use `nextTick`. [Documented here](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html#Async-Update-Queue).","2017-12-04 14:34:15","","38065","CC BY-SA 3.0"

"68066526","40408096","25","This is the most confusing thing about Vue in my opinion: Every `data` is `two-way` bound, but you can't pass `data` to components, you pass `props`, but you can't change the received `props` nor convert the `props` to `data`. Then what? One thing that I learned is that you should pass `props` down and trigger events up. That is, if the component wants to change the `props` it received, it should call an event and be ""rerendered"". But then you're left with a `one-way` binding exactly like React and I don't see the use for `data` then. Pretty confusing.","2016-11-03 17:56:55","","192729","CC BY-SA 3.0"
