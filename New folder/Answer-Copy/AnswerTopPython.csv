Guido, perhaps you should accept this and ask for a committee to redesign the import mechanism.  At a minimum, this syntax ought to work if x.py and z.py are in the same directory.  Namely if x.py has the statement, ""from .z import MyZebraClass"" x should import z EVEN if it's being run as __main__!  Why is that so hard?","2018-09-11 16:53:57","","32584","CC BY-SA 4.0"
"9929453","5458048","459","The part of the question that says ""I don't want to force my clients to install Python and modules.""  It doesn't say the clients can't do it, it says the developer doesn't want to require them to do it.  There's no point in debating the point here, because the clients are not reading SO to speak for themselves.  I wouldn't want to install a Flash development environment just to watch youtube, or a C development environment just to play Sudoku, or a Python development environment to run a version of Angry Birds written in Python.  That's what redistributable runtimes are for.","2011-11-11 20:03:14","","948866","CC BY-SA 3.0"

(Perhaps off-topic, but you did ask for ""Any suggestions"". ;)","2012-05-18 22:26:37","","455506","CC BY-SA 3.0"

If you don't like them, don't use them, and be prepared to discuss them logically without becoming religious.","2010-02-23 13:27:44","","15852","CC BY-SA 2.5"

These answers assume that you're doing the serialization yourself, rather than passing the object along to some other module that serializes it.","2019-10-17 23:59:23","","2122672","CC BY-SA 4.0"
