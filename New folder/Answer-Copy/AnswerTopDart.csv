"86986738","45409565","21","Not a full answer but a I got the same error the following way create a Scaffold with a Drawer, put a button in the drawer. bind a callback to the button that causes the app state to change in a way that the whole drawer is not rendered anymore. Then the error is caused by the drawer still being open but not in the widget tree anymore.
The solution for me to call `Navigator.pop(context)` (ie closing the drawer) before calling the `setState()` that causes the drawer to be removed.","2018-04-23 15:53:24","","1533291","CC BY-SA 3.0"
