"98165805","55744361","0","I would recommend to keep file operations out of your unittests, this way the unittests are independend of a real environment with existing paths and they keep running fast. Just build an interface for all file operations, call this interface from your code and inside the unittest you can check whether the expected file operations where triggered.","2019-04-18 10:55:54","","575765","CC BY-SA 4.0"

But we also don't fully understand how you're invoking the test.","2014-01-02 05:47:12","","1079354","CC BY-SA 3.0"

You're assert instanceof test is probably the best way to go.","2008-09-18 12:48:32","","4893","CC BY-SA 2.5"

"31322223","20866104","0","1st why do you write such hard to test code? Why there is in Registry class  method getHelper() that returns new instance of another class that use static factory to get a service? Maybe would be good to try refactor the code and everything would be more easier. Good luck","2014-01-01 22:35:34","","3087209","CC BY-SA 3.0"
