<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>package com.android.hello;

import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;

public class HelloAndroid extends Activity {

  private TextView mTextView = null;

    }

    setContentView(mTextView);
  }

<p>I thought it would be enough for the simplest case, but it always responds with the first message, no matter how I navigate away from the app.</p>
<p>I'm sure the solution is as simple as overriding <code>onPause</code> or something like that, but I've been poking away in the documentation for 30 minutes or so and haven't found anything obvious.</p>
