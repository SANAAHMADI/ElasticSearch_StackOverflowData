<blockquote>
<p>Problem at line 1 character 1: Missing &quot;use strict&quot; statement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doing some searching, I realized that some people add <code>&quot;use strict&quot;;</code> into their JavaScript code. Once I added the statement, the error stopped appearing. Unfortunately, Google did not reveal much of the history behind this string statement. Certainly it must have something to do with how the JavaScript is interpreted by the browser, but I have no idea what the effect would be.</p>
<p>So what is <code>&quot;use strict&quot;;</code> all about, what does it imply, and is it still relevant?</p>
<p>Do any of the current browsers respond to the <code>&quot;use strict&quot;;</code> string or is it for future use?</p>

<p>I am trying to return the value from the callback, as well as assigning the result to a local variable inside the function and returning that one, but none of those ways actually return the response â€” they all return <code>undefined</code> or whatever the initial value of the variable <code>result</code> is.</p>
<p><strong>Example of an asynchronous function that accepts a callback</strong> (using jQuery's <code>ajax</code> function):</p>
<pre><code>function foo() {
    var result;

    $.ajax({
        url: '...',
        success: function(response) {
            result = response;
            // return response; // &lt;- I tried that one as well
        }
    });

    return result; // It always returns `undefined`
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example using Node.js:</strong></p>
<pre><code>function foo() {
    var result;

    fs.readFile(&quot;path/to/file&quot;, function(err, data) {
        result = data;
        // return data; // &lt;- I tried that one as well
    });

    return result; // It always returns `undefined`
}

<p><strong>Example using the <code>then</code> block of a promise:</strong></p>
<pre><code>function foo() {
    var result;

    fetch(url).then(function(response) {
        result = response;
