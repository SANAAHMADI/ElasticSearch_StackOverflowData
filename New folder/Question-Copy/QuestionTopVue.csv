"42133894","1","42134176","","2017-02-09 10:16:36","","670","525659","<p>I'm  trying to understand how to properly watch for some prop variation.
I have a parent component (.vue files) that receive data from an ajax call, put the data inside an object and use it to render some child component through a v-for directive, below a simplification of my implementation:</p>
<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;player v-for=&quot;(item, key, index) in players&quot;
      :item=&quot;item&quot;
      :index=&quot;index&quot;
      :key=&quot;key&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/player&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>... then inside <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag:</p>
<pre><code> data(){
     return {
         players: {}
 },
 created(){
        let self = this;
        this.$http.get('../serv/config/player.php').then((response) =&gt; {
            let pls = response.body;
            for (let p in pls) {
                self.$set(self.players, p, pls[p]);
            }
    });
}
</code></pre>
<p>item objects are like this:</p>
<pre><code>item:{
   prop: value,
   someOtherProp: {
       nestedProp: nestedValue,
       myArray: [{type: &quot;a&quot;, num: 1},{type: &quot;b&quot; num: 6} ...]
    },
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, inside my child &quot;player&quot; component I'm trying to watch for any Item's property variation and I use:</p>
<pre><code>...
watch:{
    'item.someOtherProp'(newVal){
        //to work with changes in &quot;myArray&quot;
    },
    'item.prop'(newVal){
        //to work with changes in prop
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>It works but it seems a bit tricky to me and I was wondering if this is the right way to do it. My goal is to perform some action every time <code>prop</code> changes or <code>myArray</code> gets new elements or some variation inside existing ones. Any suggestion will be appreciated.</p>

<p>As I was walking through the generated files I noticed the following imports in the <code>src/router/index.js</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>import Vue from 'vue'
import Router from 'vue-router'
import Hello from '@/components/Hello' // &lt;- this one is what my qusestion is about

Vue.use(Router)

            component: Hello
        }
    ]
})
</code></pre>

<p>I've not seen the at sign (<code>@</code>) in a path before. I suspect it allows for relative paths (maybe?) but I wanted to be sure I understand what it truly does. </p>

<p>I tried searching around online but wasn't able to find an explanation (prob because searching for ""at sign"" or using the literal character <code>@</code> doesn't help as search criteria).</p>

<p>What does the <code>@</code> do in this path (link to documentation would be fantastic) and is this an es6 thing? A webpack thing? A vue-loader thing?</p>

<h1>UPDATE</h1>

<p>Thanks Felix Kling for pointing me to another duplicate stackoverflow question/answer about this same question.</p>

<p>While the comment on the other stackoverflow post isn't the exact answer to this question (it wasn't a babel plugin in my case) it did point me in the correct direction to find what it was. </p>

<p>In in the scaffolding that vue-cli cranks out for you, part of the base webpack config sets up an alias for .vue files:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nz1TS.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nz1TS.png"" alt=""Alias location within project""></a></p>

<p>This makes sense both in the fact that it gives you a relative path from the src file <em>and</em> it removes the requirement of the <code>.vue</code> at the end of the import path (which you normally need). </p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p>
