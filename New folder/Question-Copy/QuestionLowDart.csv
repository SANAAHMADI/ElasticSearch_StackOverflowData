<p><a href=""https://www.dartlang.org/articles/style-guide/"" rel=""nofollow"">Dart Style Guide</a></p>

<p>Term <code>PREFER</code> form this guide:</p>

<p><strong>""PREFER guidelines are practices that you should follow. However, there may be circumstances where it makes sense to do otherwise. Just make sure you understand the full implications of ignoring the guideline when you do""</strong></p>

<p>Now one of the main practices that often discussed and, of course, we should follow it:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.dartlang.org/articles/style-guide/#prefer-using-var-without-a-type-annotation-for-local-variables"" rel=""nofollow"">PREFER using var without a type annotation for local variables.</a></p>

<p>In short words, use type annotation in function body not recommended (except some very specific situations).</p>

<p>But when I look into source code of the Dart SDK I often see just the opposite.</p>

<p>Just one sample from many other similar.</p>

<p><a href=""https://code.google.com/p/dart/source/browse/branches/bleeding_edge/dart/runtime/lib/collection_patch.dart"" rel=""nofollow"">runtime/lib/collection_patch.dart</a></p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class=""lang-dart prettyprint-override""><code>void operator []=(K key, V value) {
    int hashCode = key.hashCode; 
    List buckets = _buckets; 
    int length = buckets.length; 
    int index = hashCode &amp; (length - 1); 
    _HashMapEntry entry = buckets[index]; 
    while(entry != null) {
      if (hashCode == entry.hashCode &amp;&amp; entry.key == key) {
        entry.value = value; 
        return; 
      }
      entry = entry.next; 
    }
    _addEntry(buckets, index, length, key, value, hashCode); 
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Why Dart team used type annotations for local variables instead of <code>var</code>?</p>
